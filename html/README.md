# What is Wavees Services?

> The main information about all our services.

What are Wavees services? Wavees services are an assembly of absolutely free and incredibly simple services for developers and ordinary people alike. Let's work it out together!

### Benefits for developers.

So why can our services seem to be quite useful for beginner developers? Having been in the skin of a novice developer for a long time, we realized that all services for developers are incredibly complex and incomprehensible. Why, for example, there is simply no service that would allow you to store your data very quickly? Or a service that with just one POST request could provide an understandable system of user authorization? Well, there are many such examples. We are trying to make exactly the services described above: a very simple data storage, user authorization, which requires a simple POST request to configure, or simple redirect the user to a specific page! This is exactly what we do.

Even now we can't call ourselves professional developers. It's just that the language can't turn around. But, nevertheless, we will try to make these services just for you and for our users! We still have a lot of wonderful ideas for new, useful and interesting services!

### Benefits for ordinary users.

And what can we offer for normal users? We strive to make the maximum number of incredibly simple and banal services. Yes, it even sounds weird! But why are we doing it? And here's the main thing - all our services, in fact, will be managed by users! They will have the right to do absolutely anything they want. No stupid restrictions, no surveillance for advertising! Just like users will give us ideas to improve this or that service, and that's cool! Let's show you an example: all users wanted a huge cat instead of a logo on some service, or that when you like someones post, Keanu Reeves would fly in your face with hearts instead of eyes. It may sound strange, but we'll do it! We will do everything our users tell us to do, and this is the main "feature" of our services!

# A small talk
> A small about our means of earning money for our services.

But what about our way of making money? How will we support our services?
Let's start by looking at which services may suffer from lack of money. 

We divide our services into two categories - services for users, and services for developers. And it is services for developers may suffer from lack of money for hosting. But what will happen to the services for users?

If you like our services, if you show that you like them - then we will try our best to support them in life! But, the lack of money will suffer not only our users, but also the developers themselves. Why? Because we will have to use less powerful hardware to keep the services running. Yes, it will work badly and for a long time... But it will! And we will try our best to make everything as smooth and fast as possible, even without a penny in the pocket.

Now let's talk about the main way to make money. 

We do not know yet whether there will be any advertising on our services or not. We really don't want to do it, but we'll look at the situation. So, the main way to make money is through donations from our users.  And so far, nothing more!
